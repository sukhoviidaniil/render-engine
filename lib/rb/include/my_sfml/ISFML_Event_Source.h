     * @brief Provides SFML window event support within the View.
     *
     * Although a View is typically render-only, SFML_View must poll the window
     * to acquire OS-level events such as close, resize, and input. These events
     * are tied to the SFML window and cannot be accessed otherwise.
     *
     * This does not violate the separation of concerns: SFML_View only exposes
     * the raw event stream, while interpretation and reaction to events remain
     * the responsibility of the core/application layers.
